# Project 4 MEAN STACK DEPLOYMENT ON AWS

In this project we we're tasked to implement a simple book register web form application on MEAN stack on an AWS EC2 instance.

Unlike the previous project where ReactJs was used as the frontend framework in this one we would be using AngularJs as the frontend framework, which forms the MEAN STACK.

MEAN stack is a stack of technologies that are used to build web applications and this are the technologies we will be using in this project:

- MongoDB: Which is a NoSQL, document-based database used to store application data in form of a document.

- ExpressJS: A server side web application framework for Node.js.

- Angular Js: A client side web application framework for JavaScript as its used to handle client and server requests.

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.


In this project we would be working on the following components of the MEAN stack:

- Installing NodeJs on our server.
- Installing MongoDB.
- Install Express and setting up routes to the server.
- Accessing the routes with AngularJS.
